Hi! I'm Jake Kielty, and this is my 2D Game Engine Project.

This is Missile Strike, a game where you must use your vehicle's missiles to demolish enemy structures and take out as many enemies as possible!
Knock over enemies to score points, and take out as many as you can in as few missles as possible to maximize your score! Remember, you only have 3 shots!

Controls:

Aiming: Mouse Cursor

Fire Missile: Spacebar
